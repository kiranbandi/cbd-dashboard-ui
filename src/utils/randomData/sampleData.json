PRONOUN presented with PRONOUN mother in hypovolemic shock and ultimately found to have COVID as well as failure to thrive. You identified very quickly that this was an infant that needed urgent attention. You were lucky in having senior nursing staff as well as physician colleagues that could start the care in terms of IV's, investigations etc for you. Your history and examination was adequate and you had an appropriate differential diagnosis pretty quickly. There was some diagnostic uncertainty regarding the need for a lumbar puncture when the COVID swab came back positive. After consulting with pediatrics/PICU in Saskatoon the decision was made not to do an LP in NB. I think as long as you realize that this would normally be part of the workup in a sick, undifferentiated infant in the 1st month of life. Your choice of antibiotics were appropriate and your speedy consult assisted in the timely disposition. One area you could have improved management was in choice of normal saline 0.9% as maintenance fluid - a more balanced solution with dextrose and potassium may have been a better option after the initial fluid resuscitation. Overall I think you managed the case well and the patient got a high standard of care. In the future, although difficult with experienced staff around, try be more assertive in your orders and try get more involved in the procedures (IV start, LP in needed).

Directed team to connect monitors, gave nasal prong oxygen.  Had the child put flat to measure them on NAME Broselow, but then left them lying flat.  Ordered dose of Dexamethasone 0.6mg.  Asked for temp and glucose while team was busy administering meds - maybe wait until they are finished their task.  Ordered 'racemic' Epi.  Consult Gen Peds, ECG and phlebotomy - why?  Asked for BPs to be cycled.  Asked for IV access.  Verbalized that 'sats are maintained well' when they were only 93% on NAME neb.  Went through checklist of airway equipment in case PRONOUN needed to intubate.  Asked RT to bag when sats dropped.  Gave NAME summary, realized PRONOUN had not done NAME CXR, then asked for NAME CXR.  Requested medications to be drawn up: Ketamine 13mg, Roc 26mg read off Broselow tape.  Decided to intubate with RSI, direct 1st look, bougie back-up, optimized patient position (towel roll, height of bed).  Unable to intubate, so verbalized need for needle cric and jet ventilation.

ECG/CXR/Labs are not going to help you in this case, focus on the problem.  Keep your patient sitting up when they are SOB.  Good to order to ABX, but you were thinking 'sepsis' not bacterial tracheitis.  Try Heliox in your upper airway obstructions.  Be careful when you order 'per kg' dosing - you ordered 0.6mg of Dex, and that is what your nurse gave.  Gen Peds consult early on is not realistic - You would have waited for at least NAME few hours to see if they needed to stay - the majority of croup goes home, even when they look quite sick initially.  \r\n\r\nOverall, you will have NAME more refined approach to this case once you have more experience with croup, to know that this case did not fit the usual script.","observer_name":"observer-1","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"2","resident_name":"resident-0","situation_context":"complex patient characteristic, simulation, child, yes","type":"Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-0","observation_date":"2019-10-16","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.3","feedback":"SIM: 45 y o angioedema/anaphylaxis.

I told PRONOUN if I wasn't aware that PRONOUN had charted the scoring, and I apologized that I hadn't noted it. The feedback session had to be stopped given the persistence in which NAME continued to defend PRONOUN charting of the PRAM . I wasn't able to offer the positive feedback I had observed about that specific case. I had observed PRONOUN to re-evaluate the patient frequently and spend appropriate time counseling the patient's family.

Some feedback and learning points:\r\n1. Trauma assessment of 18yo female involved in skidoo accident: NAME had a high index of suspicion for occult fracture in this pt. Pain of L spine/sacrum was out of proportion to physical exam and initial radiological findings. Appropriately advocated for CT pelvis - although the radiologist reported as N, on further review, a fracture of the sacrum was found. \r\nLearning points: Examine for pelvic instability once. Repeat exam/pressure on the pelvic girdle could potentially make a stable pelvic fracture unstable. If you don't feel movement/crepitus, move on with the exam. If you do, pelvic binder asap. \r\n- Remember to provide analgesia prior to log roll if there is an injury that will be painful with movement.\r\n2. Pt with psychiatric presentation had had been drinking ETOH:\r\nOverall good assessment and safety profile done. Identified that the pt had been drinking ETOH but no other substances ingested.\r\nThings to consider: in a patient that presents with psychiatric illness and has ingested ETOH but is clear, able to provide a good history and appears reliable with no previous hx of overdose, will lab investigations change your psychiatric mgmt? \r\n- NICKNAME though someone may have ingested ETOH, if they are lucid, able to provide a good hx and deemed competent on your assessment, a SDM cannot be implemented  just due to intoxication alone. You need to make a case that they are at risk of hurting themselves/someone else or are incapable of making safe decisions regarding their care due to substances ingested. \r\n3. 28yo female, pregnant with bronchitis vs pneumonia: Again, good assessment completed. Appropriate ddx and mgmt plan.\r\nLearning points: Review use of puffers and dosing. Remember that you can use diagnostic imaging in pregnancy IF it will contribute to or change your mgmt. Consider discussing the possibility of post viral cough vs possible asthma mgmt in a stepwise approach if there is a concern about asthma as an underlying contributor to the overall clinical picture\r\n4. 41yo presenting with vag bleed/recent TA. Good resuscitation and assessment. Consider looking at previous labs/ehealth - this patient had dropped PRONOUN hbg in the last 5 weeks. Appropriate consultation to gyne.\r\n5. 46yo with headache and clival tumor: Again good assessment, particularly neuro assessment. \r\nLearning points: in complicated pts who present with a worsening of ongoing symptoms, remember to look back at previous visits/consults to see what the physical findings were at that point then figure out what is different/what has changed that prompted the current visit. This will help with urgency of investigations/involvement of consultants. \r\nGood use of ESR to rule in/out other reasons for headache and visual disturbance.","observer_name":"observer-109","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-1","situation_context":"adult, supervising physician, complex patient characteristic, emergency department","type":"Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-1","observation_date":"2020-05-20","year_tag":"2020-1","academic_year":2019,"epa":"2.3","feedback":"NAME communicates very professionally and courteously with other members of the healthcare team.

The patient had classic vasovagal syncope on history and PRONOUN very reasonably performed an EKG and orthostatic vitals.  The next step for NICKNAME in a case like this is to explicitly consider WHY PRONOUN ordered the EKG.  For example, in a pediatric patient with history diagnostic of vasovagal syncope, with no personal or family history of cardiac illness, a normal exam and taking no medications, an EKG is an unnecessary test with extremely low yield.  That said, we often order EKG in this scenario to reassure a nervous family, or to try to prevent re-presentation as we \"didn't do anything\" in some patient's minds, or because we are aiming for rapid throughput and do not assess the patient in full before ordering preliminary investigations.  Worth considering: if EKG was busy and the department was slammed, would we have needed an EKG to SAFELY manage this patient?\r\nMy ongoing goal for NICKNAME is to be mindful of the reason for ordering tests and have a definite clinical question before ordering reflexively.

The surgeon specifically called back to commend Dr. NAME on PRONOUN diagnosis and the patient did well in the OR.","observer_name":"observer-68","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-1","situation_context":"adult, simple, emergency department, other","type":"Part A: Direct or Indirect Observation (case discussion) - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-1","observation_date":"2020-04-09","year_tag":"2020-1","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.8","feedback":"EPA completed by Dr. NAME.

A learning point we discussed was the very steady nature of the heart rate at 150bpm was less likely to be a sinus tachycardia. The options of speeding up the ECG or trialing a dose of adenosine was discussed as well as the possible benefit of reviewing an old ECG. The patient was stable so we had time to discuss options. Prior ECG and history pointed to a slower SVT. We discussed options and chose diltiazem. The patient cardioverted and was observed. PRONOUN reverted back to an SVT again which we tried vagal maneuvers first and then diltiazem again. Again the converted to NSR for a brief period. You correctly wondered if this was being driven by the stimulant use and we opted to use a benzodiazepine concurrently. PRONOUN spontaneously converted to a NSR and remained there until referral to the IM for possible admission. This was a complex case with an atypical ECG - because we had time we had the luxury of looking at old ECG's and discussing options. Review some techniques and options to elucidate narrow complex regular tachycardias. Dilitiazem is an option for SVT and consider adding it to your treatment options. Review the process of the modified Valsalva technique as I needed to walk you through it.

For sub-acute concerns that are not as serious (ie. the tremors), they can be addressed in the community after discharge or as in-patient.

Multiple seemingly unrelated complaints: Vision loss, leg weakness, leg swelling, flank pain and vomiting, sacral ulcer, fall with R shoulder pain.   Dr. NAME thoroughly summarized and documented the relevant events leading up to the patient's visit May 12 and the patient's complaints at the time of the visit.  Patient presented with a critically high blood sugar on initial nursing assessment.  \r\nDr. NAME consulted Ophthalmology emergently for the patient's vision loss / uveitis and they agreed to see in the department.   PRONOUN also consulted Internal medicine for admission and further workup and management which I agree was indicated.   \r\nThe patient was clearly complicated with multiple serious complaints, however I feel that more priority should have been given to the investigating and managing and particularly arranging disposition for the patient's critically high blood sugar in the earlier stages of the patient's assessment - specifically - ordering a VBG immediately and serially, initiating aggressive fluid replacement, potassium measurement and subsequent decisions regarding insulin administration.  I think Dr. NAME could have demonstrated more confidence in taking those actions earlier and more independently from me. PRONOUN appropriately initiated antibiotics for the patients possible pyelonephritis / sacral ulcer.\r\nNotwithstanding the complexity of the patient, the practice of Emergency Medicine involves managing multiple problems concurrently and sometimes in advance of full assessment, and arranging disposition prior to having all the answers, and I think in this particular case disposition could have been arranged earlier in the patient encounter.\r\nin fairness, I think it is quite common to get bogged down with a complicated patient even after working as a staff EP for many years, but in this particular case I believe Dr. NAME workup had more of an Internal Medicine flavour and less of an Emergency Medicine one (more exhaustive and time-consuming).   \r\nI have no doubt that Dr. NAME workup was safe - I just felt it could have been somewhat quicker.","observer_name":"observer-17","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"adult, other, emergency department, complex patient characteristic","type":"Part A: Direct or Indirect Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-10-06","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"","observer_name":"observer-191","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"","type":"","isExpired":true,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-10-06","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"","observer_name":"observer-191","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"","type":"","isExpired":true,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-10-24","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"","observer_name":"observer-192","observer_type":"Resident","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"","type":"","isExpired":true,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM(PED)","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-10-24","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"","observer_name":"observer-192","observer_type":"Resident","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"","type":"","isExpired":true,"phaseTag":"F","rotationTag":"EM(PED)","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-09-06","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"provided supportive care and completed a vaginal delivery successfully and with confidence\r\nGood job","observer_name":"observer-193","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"adult, simple, other, vaginal delivery","type":"Part A: Direct or Indirect Observation (case discussion) - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"TTD","rotationTag":"OBS/GYN","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2019-09-07","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"3.7","feedback":"NICKNAME is very keen and hard-working; a great addition to the team!\r\n\r\nGood assessment overall, approriate for early PGY1.

We discussed the case at length as the patient denied any ingestions. I took a more aggressive approach in ordering a utox because there was a history of drinking a \"slushy\" and I wanted to ensure no methadone even though it didn't necessarily fit with opioid toxidrome. In any case, the patient essentially remained well for the rest of PRONOUN stay and the workup was unfruitful.

NICKNAME has spent the past couple of months working on personal wellness and I think this will serve PRONOUN far better in the long-run rather than a couple of missed months of residency.\r\n2. Being a transfer resident NICKNAME will be excellent at some things and behind in others. Further, PRONOUN will likely progress on an \"S-shaped\" curve over the next year or two and I expect PRONOUN to be at or above PRONOUN cohort at the time of training.\r\n3.

PRONOUN on shift evals generally appear to be appropriate for the level of training, although I do note that PRONOUN is deficient in getting PRONOUN foundations of discipline EPA specifically 2.1, but further note that PRONOUN has some Core of Discipline EPA 3.1 that could have easily been sent as 2.1's. I have encouraged PRONOUN to focus on obtaining the required EPAs for Foundations so that PRONOUN can progress to the next level of training.\r\n\r\nWith respect to PRONOUN exam success we identified a key concern. Mainly that NICKNAME feels overwhelmed with the amount of information to learn which is distracting for PRONOUN. NICKNAME self-identified that PRONOUN needs to focus on one topic at a time which I think is an appropriate strategy going forward especially as PRONOUN third year rotations will generally be specialty rotations rather than EM which I hope will give PRONOUN an oppurtunity to focus.

PRONOUN EPA's over the last three months would support this. PRONOUN is a bit anxious about what the future may hold and has been considering a fellowship in ICU of late. That said, PRONOUN is concerned about the timing as PRONOUN is due to write PRONOUN exam in PRONOUN fourth year (next year), has minimal elective time and may owe the program back some time at the end of PRONOUN fifth year as PRONOUN took a personal leave. I suggested a couple of things: 1. That if PRONOUN wants to do this it would not be unreasonable to do some ER locums with a plan to start fellowship in PRONOUN seventh post-grad year. 2. to see how PRONOUN rotation's in ICU work out this winter. 3. To meet with one or both of PRONOUN Program directors (and myself) to discuss how they see the next 2 years playing out and what accommodations can be made.","observer_name":"observer-13","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"5","resident_name":"resident-2","situation_context":"","type":"Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"GEN SURG","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-2","observation_date":"2020-11-23","year_tag":"2020-2","academic_year":2020,"epa":"4.7","feedback":"I met with NICKNAME today to discuss PRONOUN progress over PRONOUN last 3 rotations which included PEM, Anaesthesia and Toxicology.\r\n\r\nOverall, NICKNAME feels that these have gone okay. PRONOUN was a bit concerned about PRONOUN Peds EM rotation as PRONOUN felt PRONOUN didn't have time to read on the block due to relatively high academic demands with Rosen's Rounds and lectures. I have suggested that PRONOUN will have multiple kicks at the can with Rosen's Rounds and am hoping PRONOUN can find a way to tailor PRONOUN learning to PRONOUN future rotations on PEM.\r\n\r\nWRT anaesthesia, NICKNAME felt that it ebbed and flowed and that at times there was not ample opportunity to practice intubation. PRONOUN was able to get about 15-20 intubations on the rotation which is a bit low. PRONOUN EPA's suggest that PRONOUN basic airway skills are adequate. In the next couple of years PRONOUN should have ample opportunity to hone this skill set.\r\n\r\nWRT Toxicology PRONOUN is a bit disappointed with the volume of calls PRONOUN is involved in as it is 1 or less a day. NICKNAME independently came up with a plan to reach out to Dr. NAME to see if more opportunities can be made available. \r\n\r\nThe next three months will see rotations on Research, ICU, Neuro and PEM. On ICU NICKNAME is hoping to hone PRONOUN skills and determine if this is a future career for PRONOUN. On Neuro PRONOUN would like to get more comfortable with CVA management and on PEM PRONOUN would like to get more confidence with pets assessment.\r\n\r\nThe other issue NICKNAME brought up was in getting US EPA's as some staff will only fill out 1 per shift. I suggested a couple of strategies 1. getting scans on U/S teaching time as PRONOUN should be able to complete one about once a month 2. Paring U/S with resuscitations as most staff would likely complete two for PRONOUN.

It is noted PRONOUN needed some time off for a knee surgery. NICKNAME feels the knee surgery has set up back (physically and mentally) to some extent as PRONOUN functionally recovers from the knee surgery. That said, while there are only a few new EPA's, they suggest PRONOUN is preforming as expected. Further, NICKNAME tells me that PRONOUN CITE exam score significantly improved (to 65%) and although PRONOUN doesn't have a percentile rank I suspect that PRONOUN score is in keeping with PRONOUN peers. This is quite encouraging. Great work! I've advised PRONOUN to keep doing what he's doing, treat it as a marathon and not a sprint and ensure that PRONOUN is taking enough time for self-care. \r\n\r\nNICKNAME has upcoming rotations in PEM, PICU, ICU and Plastics and hopes to continue to hone ED appropriate skills and knowledge.

NICKNAME did well with a majority of the cases that PRONOUN saw. PRONOUN differentials were good and PRONOUN judiciously used tests. There were a couple more complex cases (difficult patients with multiple issues) that NICKNAME had some challenges with making decisions.

I told PRONOUN all the extra reading will also be very helpful for PRONOUN examination as a large portion is based on pediatrics. Additionally NICKNAME finished up a rotation in North Battleford. PRONOUN got ample opportunity for some independent type practice and to run the department flow on PRONOUN own – this was a good confidence booster for PRONOUN and PRONOUN should be able to start to transition those skills into working in the Saskatoon EDs. \r\n\r\nI did not have a chance to work any shifts with NICKNAME during the last several months because PRONOUN did not do any adult ED rotations.

There was very little history given for this case so talking with family was so important.  Try to ask the history before the bad news is given.  This also helps to figure out how much they know.

Most of the time, the decision for CT scan can be made on initial assessment and differential diagnosis. Only occasionally will it be changed when lab work is back and is not as predicted. Sometimes the doc needs time to make that decision (serial exams) in which lab work can be used to bridge that time. When I went back with Dr. NAME to examine the patient, PRONOUN was quite tender and we elected to order the CT scan to r/o surgical abdominal pathology. The CT was unchanged so PRONOUN initial decision to not do the CT scan would not have resulted in any patient harm. By discharge the patient's abdominal exam was much more benign. Would the patient have settled eventually without investigation or did the negative CT scan contribute to PRONOUN reassurance? Always difficult to tell. We discussed thinking about the catastrophic but remote diagnoses and deciding if you have ruled them out sufficiently on initial assessment and asking yourself if you would sleep well at night if you sent them home without investigations.

We received 3 patients in handover (one awaiting t/f to Ortho, one awaiting sobering up and reassessment, and the other awaiting morning CT that sounded sick). At the start of shift, there were 5 patient's WTBS, all stable in the WR.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the importance of assessing any handed over patients that sound unwell. PRONOUN assessed the CT patient and changed the imaging study appropriately (to get delayed phase contrast for ureteric assessment). We also discussed the important of ordering home meds and preventing delirium in patients awaiting t/f out of hospital, as they can be here sometimes for days.\r\n\r\nTo waste less time looking for forms, I shared my Google Drive folder with PRONOUN of commonly used ED forms. I recommended PRONOUN download them to the SHA Drive so it's accessible easily across all sites. This saves time by avoiding Forms on Demand, and by avoiding random filing cabinet searches.\r\n\r\nI had a few recommendations for improving flow at the start of a shift. I find it helpful to see at least 3 or 4 patients in a row before charting or before performing procedures (e.g. laceration repair). This ensures that labs are completed in a timely manner and are being processed while you chart or suture.\r\n\r\nCharting was succinct and accurate. Encouraged to trial voice dictation in case you find it to be more efficient, recognizing it's different for everyone.\r\n\r\nGood avoidance of unnecessary IV's and labs for WR patients. There were a few patients that could've gone either way, but you appropriately trialed oral treatment and observation which led to quicker dispositions and decreased nursing burden (esp. with only have one triage RN).\r\n\r\nFor consult notes, be sure to click the boxes for time/date/method of being sent (e.g. fax, phone, etc).\r\n\r\nFor discharge charting, always documents how much of a Rx was given, especially for controlled substances (gabapentin, opiates, etc.) in case the pharmacy calls another doc for details. It also helps if the patient returns asking for a Rx and lies about what was previously given.\r\n\r\nGood job not seeing patients toward end of shift that would keep you here longer than your shift allows. They were all stable, and only 5 WTBS for the incoming doc is very reasonable, especially when they have a learner working alongside them. Also, always know that ordering workups/treatments around the time of RN shift change never works very well as they won't get processed for quite a while, so even for seemingly quick things (UA, XR), it'll always be late and end up keeping you here too long.\r\n\r\nManaged all patients safely and independently, only requiring some advice on one patient as any ED doc would ask a colleague for help.","observer_name":"observer-68","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-3","situation_context":"acute care, simple","type":"Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"TP","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-3","observation_date":"2022-05-07","year_tag":"2022-1","academic_year":2021,"epa":"4.1","feedback":"NICKNAME and I worked together on NAME busy evening shift.

NAME has reflected on this and felt that PRONOUN has not been getting as many EPAs as PRONOUN would like lately. PRONOUN has run into trouble with staff physicians not filling these out in a timely fashion and then the staff forgetting the patients that the EPA was sent for.

NAME has done some initial ground work into looking at a project surrounding the health outcomes of community paramedicine. PRONOUN has met with two people within Medavie (in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon) and has begun to formulate an understanding of the specific things that the community paramedic teams do. PRONOUN does not have a clear outline of what PRONOUN wants to do yet, but as this project can fall under the QI domain I have asked PRONOUN to do a brief lit search on community paramedicine and to come to the January QI wall walk with some more information on the evidence/local actions of the community teams so we can discuss this further. PRONOUN does not have a supervisor yet, but this is something I may be able to help PRONOUN with and should we tackle this from a provincial angle we will likely be able to involve Dr NAME in this as well to leverage PRONOUN connections.\r\n\r\n3.

Your 2x2 table was correct but the total number of participants was off by 5 somehow (minor discrepancy that didn't really change the results). Also, you calculated specificity incorrectly by using the false positives as the denominator rather than the total number of people who did not have a PE. This resulted in your +LR and -LR calculations being slightly incorrect as well.\r\n-Good job on applying the rule to this patient.\r\n-Your test threshold description was partially correct. An important part of the concept that you missed is that there is harm to tests like a D-Dimer (e.g. in this case, it might result in the patient getting a CT scan they don't need). The test threshold is the risk that is acceptable given that aiming to lower the risk further would result in additional harm. e.g. for PE, doing a DDimer when the likelihood of PE is already below 2% based on clinical assessment and the use of the PERC rule is more likely to be harmful than helpful for the patient.\r\n\r\nFeedback on CATCH/PECARN/CHALICE Paper:\r\n-Your 2x2 table was put together correctly. Your calculations of Sn/Sp/PPV/NPV/+LR/-LR were correct.\r\n-I disagree with the reason provided for the rules performing more poorly in this study than they had in their derivation studies. The smaller sample size could have certainly led to less accurate results, but this would be demonstrated by less precise results (larger CI's - as were seen) rather than different results. Rather, the reason that rules generally perform worse in validation studies than in derivation studies is due to 'overfitting' - \"the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably.\" As the new data collected is different than the data in the derivation study, it is likely that the rule will not perform as well. This is a key reason why validation studies (and not just derivation studies) are needed prior to the application of a new clinical decision rule.\r\n-Regarding application, I think that from this study it is reasonable to conclude that PECARN is superior for ruling out injuries (it has the highest sensitivity). I'm not sure what was mentioned at half-day regarding other validation studies, but this study suggests that the Sn of CATCH and CHALICE are quite a bit lower.","observer_name":"observer-0","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"5","resident_name":"resident-6","situation_context":"","type":"Part A: Submission of Written Report - Form 4","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"TTD","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-6","observation_date":"2019-11-01","year_tag":"2019-2","academic_year":2019,"epa":"2.5","feedback":"NAME was able to both accurately utilize the clinical decision rules in clinical cases and outline the rationale for them with reference to their underlying literature.

PRONOUN did well with listening to the presentations w/o interrupting and then asking specific questions at then end regarding information that wasn't clear in the presentation. PRONOUN had our student try and come up with a plan for each of the cases and then offered PRONOUN feedback on some additional considerations/things that the plan should include (e.g. adding a CRP to the blood work for a lady with the brain abscess & weighted views for the foot X-ray). I also had NAME coach our student through consults before calling radiology for another patient and before calling NSx for the patient with the brain abscess and had PRONOUN provide feedback to the student before making the consult and then had PRONOUN be with the student when PRONOUN called for imaging/consult as back-up. PRONOUN did well with this without any issues. \r\n\r\nNAME also provided some teaching around RAPD and lateral canthotomy to PRONOUN. \r\n\r\nFollowing the shift PRONOUN provided this feedback to the student:  think your strengths from today's shift were: thoughtful completeness in your history and physical exams and exceptional clear communication with specialists. I also really appreciate your ability to commit to a plan - this will make you so much stronger clinically! One specific thing you could work on (that I noticed with the brain abscess patient) - is asking patients early on about what they have tried at home for pain control, what worked or didn't work, and ordering something up front to try to help with their pain. Especially when we so often cannot give people diagnosis (think of all the abdo pain NYD or chest pain NYD you see) - treating their pain makes them feel like we did help in a little way. \r\n\r\nOverall I felt NAME did well with this initial experience of a teaching shift. PRONOUN was very patient with allowing the learner to present cases without interrupting and provided teaching around adjustments to the plans the students had made and PRONOUN rationale with this. PRONOUN provided coaching around tips for making consults \"name, patient into & relevant profile and ask and then more into background\" and was present when each of the calls were made. The student felt very supportive for this -- I think we often underestimate how challenging calling consultants can be fore junior learners and this learner was very appreciative of this. PRONOUN mini teaching session was also well received although was significantly higher level than 4th year medical student. \r\n\r\nFeedback going forward \r\n1) This was an \"early\" teaching shift as we typically do not do education block until PGY-3. There is an ed block teaching curriculum and it includes literature on ways to improve bedside teaching, case presentations, feedback, supervising procedures etc. You can consider reading some of these articles early if you want some extra tips and tricks for your teaching.\r\n2) With very junior learners (medical students, PGY1s) I will always interview and examine the patient myself -- as you do more teaching shifts, make sure that you continue to do this as well as very junior learners don't always know what they don't know so it is important to always double check their assessment - the degree to which you have to do this decreases with higher level learners, but try and keep this as a habit whenever you review/teach on shift","observer_name":"observer-21","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"3","resident_name":"resident-6","situation_context":"","type":"Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"EM","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-6","observation_date":"2021-08-09","year_tag":"2021-2","academic_year":2021,"epa":"3.17","feedback":"Provided excellent bedside teaching of medical student while managing the rest of the department.

I subsequently called the radiologist and was met with a similar resistance ultimately after a lengthy condescending conversation radiologist agreed to do the scan.  Subsequent scan was positive for extravasation of contrast outside bladder with a potential ureter injury. Mac called Urology who came to see the patient.  Learning points from this case included 1.  Repeating imaging if the clinical situation is worsening regardless if the patient had just had imaging done in the past 12 hours.  2.  Strategies to handle difficult interactions with consultants.  3.  Advocating for your patient's despite back lash from consultants.

PRONOUN fielded all of the calls and provided advice to the sending physician as well as to the nurse/paramedic team while I listened in the background and occasionally send NAME text message with my thoughts on what should be done.  These pieces of advice were mostly logistical in nature (clarifying that an accepting physician for NAME trauma patient had been established); I did not need to give NAME any advice on medical management.  This included NAME very sick patient with pancreatitis being transferred from NAME regional ICU to Saskatoon who had hypotension with multiple pressors, electrolyte disturbances and hyperglycemia.  Previous feedback to NAME from me was to 'interrupt' the accepting physician once NAME disposition was established to get the transport modality going and save transport time.

Similarly, sending physicians caring for ill patients in rural settings can be very overwhelmed.

If you sense that the sending physician is unclear of their next task, just offer NAME quick summary, ask if they understand the next steps or get them to repeat back what they are going to do next?  Once you know the transport modality, be explicit in sharing this with the sending physician 'Dr. X, Air Ambulance will be coming to HELP YOU CARE for your patient.  X, can you let Dr NAME NAME what time the team will be arriving.'  Knowing that they only have 45 mins or an hour left before help arrives will be very helpful.","observer_name":"observer-1","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-8","situation_context":"adult, pre-hospital setting, complex patient characteristic","type":"Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"ACE","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-8","observation_date":"2020-10-15","year_tag":"2020-2","academic_year":2020,"epa":"3.12","feedback":"This was a complicated case of a teenage primigravida who was unaware of pregnancy and presented to a remote ER in labour with breech presentation and possible cord presentation.

This was one of NAME first expierences with a handover that included an unstable patient (being assessed by cardiology) and a patient without a clear plan (thoracic back pain NYD - had been assessed by the med student late in the shift and the handing over MD didn't have a great idea of what was wrong & what the plan was). It was also a \"double handover\" in the sense that the handing over doc told us about all of the patients then went and reassessed several of them and then re-handed over with new info/several different plans. NAME asked questions to clarify during the handover (collateral info regarding ADLs, goals of care, how the family is managing for the elderly patient with thoracic back pain) and when the handing over doc couldn't clarify certain info, PRONOUN didn't push on this and made plan to just review patient right after handover. After receving handover PRONOUN quickly reviewed the unstable patient consulted to cardio (dialysis patient with hyperk and a junctional rhythm at 30 bpm not responding to medical therapies). PRONOUN established that the CCU staff cardiologist was there and taking the patient to CTU. PRONOUN then went to the undifferentiated back pain patient and restarted hx/physical exam from scratch and called the patient's son for the collateral the handing over MD did not know. PRONOUN ordered a CXR and established the patient had a lobar pneumonia and given that the family was not managing at home, consulted CTU. \r\n\r\nNAME and I discussed that handovers can be significanlty different between different MDs and that we all have days where handover is less than ideal. PRONOUN did the right thing with quickly assessing the unstable patient and making sure they were being dealt with and then starting over with the back pain patient. We discussed that some of our colleagues would likely have given pushback on that handover but from the collegial standpoint the department was in decent shape and the handing over MD was already there 1h post shift so pushback wouldn't solve anything and that we would appreciate someone helping us out with that handover in the even that we were in that position. I gave PRONOUN a tip that when you receive an unclear handover, it is always best to reassess them as soon as possible because if you end up changing the plan/ordering additional investigations, it helps when it is earlier in your shift rather than later when you are tired and cognitive load is high.\r\n\r\nOverall, NAME did very well with this. I put I had to be there just in case because it was one of PRONOUN first times taking not clear cut handover and wanted PRONOUN to talk me through PRONOUN approach and be there to support ad review PRONOUN plan but really didn't add anything to it.

Going forward I would give NAME the following suggestions:\r\n1. When Link Centre gives you the times for each transport option before you link into the call, make NAME quick mental memory of quickest BLS and quickest ALS option.  This will allow to make NAME quick decision during the call and save the time of you asking again during the call.\r\n2. When STARS and Air Ambulance are close in time, if the patient is stable enough for an airport rendez-vous, Air Ambulance is usually faster.\r\n3. Don't assume NAME resource is available, particularly Air Ambulance.  They are often flying other less acute patients and may not have NAME resource.  So ask if one is available before you state that Air Ambulance will go.  Same with STARS - can be unavailable due to weather, decontamination, etc.\r\n4. Trans-west is an Air Ambulance option with NAME BLS crew.  NAME good option for stable trauma patients and stroke patients.  STEMI/ACS patients need an ALS crew.\r\n5. Only use your critical care resources when they are truly needed.  We had NAME great example of using Transwest, then 10 minutes later needing Air Ambulance for NAME much sicker patient.\r\n6. Be careful with giving medical advice upfront, so you don't step on the toes of the accepting physician.  Once they are in transport, they are under your medical control.  \r\n7. When you do give advice, try to gauge the comfort level of the sending physician's acute care skills.  Keep it very simple and recognize the crew will often arrive within an hour, so no point in giving advice on interventions that would come in hour.  Acute care interventions don't happen fast in rural EDs.\r\n8. When there is lengthy discussion around initial management, politely interrupt to get transport started.  Often the crew can be 10 minutes on the way to the patient before the initial management suggestions are finished.","observer_name":"observer-1","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"2","resident_name":"resident-8","situation_context":"simple, adult, EP to OP at another hospital","type":"Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"ACE","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-8","observation_date":"2020-08-07","year_tag":"2020-2","academic_year":2020,"epa":"4.5","feedback":"Resident was able to provide prompt and appropriate advise to various stakeholders as required.\r\nPRONOUN had no direct interaction with patient","observer_name":"observer-11","observer_type":"Clinical Supervisor","professionalism_safety":"","rating":"4","resident_name":"resident-8","situation_context":"complex clinical characteristic, adult, EP to PCP","type":"Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1","isExpired":false,"phaseTag":"CORE","rotationTag":"ACE","program":"EM"},{"username":"resident-dummy-8","observation_date":"2020-12-20","year_tag":"2020-2","academic_year":2020,"epa":"4.5","feedback":"Resident received 3 handovers and made sure to understand what PRONOUN expectations as the receiving physician were.

Time management is critical at this stage of training and something NICKNAME clearly recognizes.\r\n\r\nTOXICOLOGY: On the current review and prior review NICKNAME has commented on a lack of exposure to toxicology cases. PRONOUN should be commented for recognizing this gap in PRONOUN knowledge, but it needs to be tempered with the recognition that toxicology is often (INITIAL) a senior resident skill and (b) aside from the usual opioids most toxidromes / toxic ingestions are rare occurrences (e.g. iron) and (c) as such there is dedicated time in the curriculum for toxicology training. \r\n\r\nREGINA: Prior to going to Regina NICKNAME and I had discussed the unique learning characteristics of this site. PRONOUN clearly internalized those lessons and had uniformly positive reviews from Regina staff. PRONOUN notes that due to the more hands-off nature of learning in regina PRONOUN had greater exposure to sick patients. This has demonstrably paid off when we compare comments on PRONOUN procedural sedation from August 3rd with Dr. NAME which notes that the \"next steps for improvement are pre-sedation assessment and continue to work on medication titration\" while a similar procedure on November 28 resulted in comments stating, \"PRONOUN took an appropriate pre-sedation history\" and then \"provided fentanyl in 25 mcg aliquots and ... then titrated propofol in 20-30 mg doses\"\r\n\r\nRESEARCH: Speaking of scheduling it is important to be proactive about research projects at this stage and NICKNAME has identified PRONOUN current project as falling behind schedule due to a variety of factors (i.e. lead resident otherwise occupied).
