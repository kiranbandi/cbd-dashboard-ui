Simply put, it will readily identify any EPAs within your program that are not getting filled out at an adequate rate so that investigations and interventions can occur to address anticipated shortfalls before residents reach the end of the stage. The percentage values are calculated within each stage using data from all of the EPAs completed in the selected academic year using the following equation: 100 * (Number of TTD 1 EPAs completed / Number of TTD EPAs completed) / (Number of TTD 1 EPAs needed / Number of TTD EPAs needed). Previous years can be loaded using the drop-down menu.`,
